# SCHOOLBASE

Schoolbase is a modern, high-performance school management frontend built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **Framer Motion**, **TanStack Query**, **Zod**, and **ShadCN UI**. Each school runs on its own dedicated instance for privacy, customization, and smooth experiences across Admins, Teachers, Students, and Parents.

## Why it matters

- Delivers real-time visibility to admins, teachers, students, and parents with audit-ready accuracy.
